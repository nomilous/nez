    #  - To receive edge events when the

    #
    # Plugin should define the list of node classes that it
    # handles:
    # 
    # eg. 
    # 
    # In the following edge definition... 
    # 
    #    fox 'jumps over', (dog) -> 
    #
    # ...fox and dog are node classes and the following
    #    plugin property declares to the plugin loader
    #    this this plugin handles the specified node 
    #    classes.

    # Hypothetically: 
    #
    # The following nodes on the tree should each be handled by
    # the 'Requirements' plugin...
    # 
    #    Session
    # 
    #        as:    'user of the system'
    #        need:  'logout button'
    #        to:    'safely leave my workstation unattended' 
    #        title: 'logout', (specs) ->
    #         
    #    Session
    # 
    #        as:    'user of the system'
    #        want:  'lock session button'
    #        to:    'secure my workstation and still keep my work in progress'
    #        title: 'lock', (specs) ->
    #
    # 
    # ...but the node class: 'Session' was not declared as handled by 
    #    the 'Requirements' plugin so the walker will attempt to match
    #    a plugin from the keys of the node properties hash.
    # 
    #     
    # Plugins should therefore define the list of key matches. 
    # (which may be an empty array)
    # 

    matches: ['speed','colour','disposition']

    # And for each a passthough function that (can do 
    # other things but) should return reference to a 
    # handler when appropriate
