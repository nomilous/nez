        A framework capable of housing an heirarchy of inter-dependant 
        Objectives with an extended capacity to express the levels of 
        accessability to the in-process accumulation of information
        stored in that heirarchy to enable the various role players
        an appropriate view into progress being made.
        

        And for the specific case of software design and implementation, 
        a system capable of measuring the efforts and successes throughout 
        the process of realizing the Objectives by harnessing information 
        garnishable from the development process itself (the test runs).
